## 🔍 Smart Complaint Clustering (Core Feature)

This module automatically groups customer complaints into meaningful clusters, names them (e.g., `"Payment Issues"`, `"Delivery Issues"`).

### How it works

1. **Preprocessing** – removes numbers, `#`, punctuation (keeps apostrophes). No stopword removal – preserves meaning.  
2. **Embedding** – converts reviews into vectors using a Sentence‑Transformer (`all-mpnet-base-v2` or fine‑tuned model).  
3. **Dimensionality reduction** – UMAP (5 components, cosine distance).  
4. **Clustering** – HDBSCAN (density‑based, automatically marks noise as outliers).  
5. **Topic extraction** – BERTopic extracts c‑TF‑IDF words.  
6. **Category mapping** – each cluster is compared to 11 predefined category descriptions (Payment, Delivery, Technical, Account, Product Quality, Customer Service, Shipping Damage, Subscription, Checkout, Return/Refund). If similarity ≥ threshold, the cluster gets a standard name; otherwise it receives a dynamic name generated from the two most frequent content words + suffix (`Issues` / `Error` / `Delay`).  
7. **Merge duplicates** – clusters with the same name are combined.

### How to use it in the dashboard

1. Upload a CSV with a `review` column.  
2. Go to the **Dashboard** tab and click **“Find Complaint Clusters”**.  
3. Wait for the analysis (first run loads the embedding model).  
4. Expandable clusters – each shows name, number of reviews, some complaints.

## 📥 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prateekiiitg56/BizInsight-AI.git
cd BizInsight-AI
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Choose **one** of the options below to isolate your project dependencies.

#### Option A: Using Standard Python (venv)
* **Create the environment:**
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```
* **Activate the environment:**
  * **Windows:**
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  * **macOS / Linux:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

#### Option B: Using Anaconda (conda)
* **Create and activate the environment:**
  ```bash
  conda create --name BizInsight-AI-env python=3.10 -y
  conda activate BizInsight-AI-env
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is active, install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

1. Create a free account at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) and get your API key.

2. Copy the example env file:
   - **macOS / Linux:**
```bash
     cp .env.example .env
```
   - **Windows:**
```bash
     copy .env.example .env
```

3. Open the `.env` file and add your API key:
```
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

> ⚠️ Never share or commit your `.env` file. It is already listed in `.gitignore`.
