## 🔍 Smart Complaint Clustering (Core Feature)

This module automatically groups customer complaints into meaningful clusters, names them (e.g., `"Payment Issues"`, `"Delivery Issues"`).

### How it works

1. **Preprocessing** – removes numbers, `#`, punctuation (keeps apostrophes). No stopword removal – preserves meaning.  
2. **Embedding** – converts reviews into vectors using a Sentence‑Transformer (`all-mpnet-base-v2` or fine‑tuned model).  
3. **Dimensionality reduction** – UMAP (5 components, cosine distance).  
4. **Clustering** – HDBSCAN (density‑based, automatically marks noise as outliers).  
5. **Topic extraction** – BERTopic extracts c‑TF‑IDF words.  
6. **Category mapping** – each cluster is compared to 11 predefined category descriptions (Payment, Delivery, Technical, Account, Product Quality, Customer Service, Shipping Damage, Subscription, Checkout, Return/Refund). If similarity ≥ threshold, the cluster gets a standard name; otherwise it receives a dynamic name generated from the two most frequent content words + suffix (`Issues` / `Error` / `Delay`).  
7. **Merge duplicates** – clusters with the same name are combined.

### How to use it in the dashboard

1. Upload a CSV with a `review` column.  
2. Go to the **Dashboard** tab and click **“Find Complaint Clusters”**.  
3. Wait for the analysis (first run loads the embedding model).  
4. Expandable clusters – each shows name, number of reviews, some complaints.

## 🧠 RAG Chatbot – Ask Your Reviews

A dedicated conversational AI that answers business questions based **only** on the uploaded customer reviews.

### How it works

1. **Vector Store – Embeddings & Storage**
Customer reviews are converted into 384‑dimensional vectors using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and stored in ChromaDB along with metadata (sentiment, date). The vector store is re‑synced automatically after every CSV upload. 
2. **Smart Retrieval – Finding the Right Reviews**
When a user asks a question, the backend does three things:

Sentiment filtering – if the question mentions “problem”, “issue”, etc., only negative reviews are retrieved; for “good”, “great” etc., only positive reviews are used.

Multi‑Query expansion – the LLM generates 3 rephrased versions of the question to catch more relevant reviews (improves recall).

Cross‑encoder re‑ranking – a neural model (`ms‑marco-MiniLM‑L‑6‑v2`) scores each candidate review and keeps only the top‑8 most relevant ones (improves precision).  
3. **LLM Answer – Grounded & Strict**
The top‑8 reviews are inserted into a strict prompt that instructs the LLM (Google Gemini via OpenRouter) to answer only based on the provided context. If the answer is not in the reviews, the model says “The customer reviews do not mention this information.”
4. **Conversation Memory – Follow‑up Questions**
Session‑based memory (ConversationBufferMemory) keeps the chat history. The user can ask follow‑up questions without repeating context, and the retrieval automatically incorporates sentiment‑aware filtering for each new turn.

### How to use it

1. Start the FastAPI backend (separate terminal):  
   ```bash
   python run_chatbot_api.py
